        "text = \"Rutherford's atomic model was quite commendable when it came to explaining the structure of atoms. However, Rutherford's atomic model was not very appropriate theoretically. And why are we saying so? We know that any charged object which revolves in a circular motion gains acceleration gradually. Similarly, if the electron is moving fast in a circular path, then the electron will also gain acceleration. And on gaining acceleration, the electron's bound to liberate energy in some form. Now if the electron continuously keeps radiating energy, then ultimately all the energy of the electron will get over and all the energy of the electron will fall into the nucleus. This would result in high instability of the atom. But wait a second, all these things do not happen in an atom. And how do we know this? Because in nature, all the atoms are stable. That means the hypothesis put forth by Rutherford's was also incorrect. Not really, the hypothesis put forth by Rutherford just needed slight modifications. slight modifications were made by the next legendary scientist in our list called Niels Bohr. the next legendary scientist in our list called Niels Bohr made a few additional explanations to describe the atomic structure. The postulates put forward by the next legendary scientist in our list called Niels Bohr were as follows. Firstly, only certain special orbits called discrete orbits of electrons are allowed inside the atom. Secondly, while revolving in only certain special orbits called discrete orbits of electrons, the electrons do not radiate energy. Now these points definitely tell us why an atom is so stable. But what exactly are these paths or orbits in which the electrons revolve around the nucleus? Let's understand with an example. Do you know how our solar system is? Yes, our solar system appears somewhat like this. Now here, the sun is stationary at the centre while the planets revolve around the sun. But have you noticed that the planets always revolve in fixed paths? We never find any planet jumping to a different path all of a sudden, right? the planets always encircle the sun in defined paths. In a similar way, we have the atomic structure. The nucleus acts like the sun and the electrons are like planets which revolve in fixed defined orbitals. fixed defined orbitals are referred to as shells or energy levels. Now the name energy levels gets us to an important concept. the next legendary scientist in our list called Niels Bohr suggested that the electrons revolving in fixed defined orbitals do not radiate energy. Now this is justified when we use the name energy levels because the name energy levels indicates that each shell has got a defined energy level. That means when the electrons revolve in fixed defined orbitals, the electrons do not liberate any form of energy. And how do we name fixed defined orbitals to indicate fixed defined orbitals's position? It's simple. Beginning from the one near The nucleus, we name fixed defined orbitals as the K shell, L shell, M shell, N shell and so on. Yes, K L M N and so on. And what if we want to number fixed defined orbitals? In that case, we use the letter N in lower case and write fixed defined orbitals as the letter N equals 1, the letter N equals 2, N equals 3 and so on, beginning from the 1 next to The nucleus. So we can name fixed defined orbitals alphabetically or we can even number fixed defined orbitals. With all these theories and points known, do we now know the structure of a typical atom completely? The nucleus contains positive protons and the electrons revolving around in fixed orbitals. Is that how an atom is structured? Not really. We still have one more subatomic particle left. And what and where could one more subatomic particle be? Let's find that out. It was around the year 1932 when a famous English physicist Sir James Chadwick found one more subatomic particle. a famous English physicist Sir James Chadwick found that one more subatomic particle had a mass almost equivalent to that of the proton. And what about one more subatomic particle's charge? Astonishingly, one more subatomic particle had no charge. Yes, one more subatomic particle was neutral. one more subatomic particle was later named as neutron, denoted by the letter N. Does now we have the complete design of an atom? In the center lies the nucleus having positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, while the negatively charged electrons revolve in fixed orbitals around The nucleus. But how exactly are the electrons distributed in fixed orbitals around the nucleus? Is there a way to find out the maximum number of electrons that one orbital can contain? Or is it that the electrons are randomly scattered in fixed orbitals around the nucleus? Let's find out the answers to these questions in our upcoming video.\"\n",

              "\"Rutherford's atomic model was quite commendable when it came to explaining the structure of atoms. However, Rutherford's atomic model was not very appropriate theoretically. Now if the electron continuously keeps radiating energy, then ultimately all the energy of the electron will get over and all the energy of the electron will fall into the nucleus. That means the hypothesis put forth by Rutherford's was also incorrect. Not really, the hypothesis put forth by Rutherford just needed slight modifications. slight modifications were made by the next legendary scientist in our list called Niels Bohr. the next legendary scientist in our list called Niels Bohr made a few additional explanations to describe the atomic structure. The postulates put forward by the next legendary scientist in our list called Niels Bohr were as follows. Firstly, only certain special orbits called discrete orbits of electrons are allowed inside the atom. Secondly, while revolving in only certain special orbits called discrete orbits of electrons, the electrons do not radiate energy. Now these points definitely tell us why an atom is so stable. But what exactly are these paths or orbits in which the electrons revolve around the nucleus? Let's understand with an example. Do you know how our solar system is? Yes, our solar system appears somewhat like this. Now here, the sun is stationary at the centre while the planets revolve around the sun. But have you noticed that the planets always revolve in fixed paths? We never find any planet jumping to a different path all of a sudden, right? the planets always encircle the sun in defined paths. The nucleus acts like the sun and the electrons are like planets which revolve in fixed defined orbitals. the next legendary scientist in our list called Niels Bohr suggested that the electrons revolving in fixed defined orbitals do not radiate energy. Now this is justified when we use the name energy levels because the name energy levels indicates that each shell has got a defined energy level. That means when the electrons revolve in fixed defined orbitals, the electrons do not liberate any form of energy. And what if we want to number fixed defined orbitals? In that case, we use the letter N in lower case and write fixed defined orbitals as the letter N equals 1, the letter N equals 2, N equals 3 and so on, beginning from the 1 next to The nucleus. So we can name fixed defined orbitals alphabetically or we can even number fixed defined orbitals. With all these theories and points known, do we now know the structure of a typical atom completely? The nucleus contains positive protons and the electrons revolving around in fixed orbitals. a famous English physicist Sir James Chadwick found that one more subatomic particle had a mass almost equivalent to that of the proton. And what about one more subatomic particle's charge? Astonishingly, one more subatomic particle had no charge. one more subatomic particle was later named as neutron, denoted by the letter N. Does now we have the complete design of an atom? In the center lies the nucleus having positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, while the negatively charged electrons revolve in fixed orbitals around The nucleus. But how exactly are the electrons distributed in fixed orbitals around the nucleus? Is there a way to find out the maximum number of electrons that one orbital can contain? Or is it that the electrons are randomly scattered in fixed orbitals around the nucleus? Let's find out the answers to these questions in our upcoming video.\""

              "[\" a green color component called chloroplasts is responsible for the green color of plants and leaves. Leaves on the plant have pores, very similar to the pores on the skin of our bodies. This is because energy from the sun is absorbed by the water layers and only some amount of energy actually reaches the plant. Do kids know how plants make plants's own food? No? Well, this video elaborates the process of photosynthesis by which plants make plants's own food. chemical energy is used by plants for growth and nourishment. Once the carbon dioxide and the water reach a green color component called chloroplasts in the presence of sunlight, the process of photosynthesis starts to take place. The carbon dioxide present in the air, which is responsible for Photosynthesis, enters the plant through pores, very similar to the pores on the skin of our bodies. This system transports vital nutrients to the plant. pores, very similar to the pores on the skin of our bodies are called stomata. The following reaction takes place in the leaves of the plant during the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the conversion of light energy into chemical energy by plants. Leaves have important cells called mesofil cells. Plants have tubes called xylum, located in the stems through which the water from the ground is sucked into the leaves. This system is spread throughout the different parts of the plant, including the stem, branches, and all the way up to the leaves. Xylums in the plant are like blood vessels in the human body that act as an important means of transportation of water and nutrients. Glucose is used by the plants for the plants's growth. The oxygen that is released is used by human beings to breathe during human beings's respiration process ever wondered why the process of photosynthesis is called photosynthesis? Well the word photosynthesis is a combination of two Greek words photo and synthesis. important cells called mesofil cells contain a green color component called chloroplasts. This system works similar to humans sucking liquids through a straw. Photosynthesis is the process used by plants to make plants's own food or in more complex terms.\",\n",
              " \" Vitamins're the body's builders, defenders, and maintenance workers, helping the body's to build muscle and bone, make use of nutrients, capture and use energy, and heal wounds. On the other hand, too much of any vitamin can cause toxicity in the body, so there goes the myth that loading yourself with supplements is a great idea. The water-solubles are vitamin C and B-complex vitamins that are made up of eight different types that each do something unique. Vitamin D gathers calcium and phosphorus so we can make bones, and vitamin E works as an antioxidant, getting rid of elements in the body that can damage cells. Because fat-soluble vitamins can't make use of the blood's watery nature, fat-soluble vitamins need something else to move fat-soluble vitamins around. Vitamins come in two types, lipid-soluble and water-soluble, and the difference between two types, lipid-soluble and water-soluble determines how the body transports and stores vitamins and gets rid of the excess. So how does the body get vitamins from out there into here? That's dependent on the form vitamins take. Because blood plasma is water-based, water-soluble vitamins C and B have water-soluble vitamins C and B's transport cut out for water-soluble vitamins C and B, and can move around freely within the body. Vitamins are organic compounds we need to ingest in small amounts to keep functioning. The body treats these parts like a pantry, storing fat-soluble vitamins there and rationing fat-soluble vitamins out when needed, meaning we shouldn't overload on this type of vitamin because The body is generally well stocked. And just like letters build words, letters're the building blocks that keep the body running. lipid-soluble vitamins, dissolved in fat and found in foods like dairy, butter, and oils make it through the stomach and the intestine, where an acidic substance called bile flows in from the liver, breaking up the fat and preparing the fat for absorption through the intestinal wall. So this difference between water or fat-soluble vitamins determines how fat-soluble vitamins get into the blood, but also how fat-soluble vitamins're stored or rejected from the body. The water-solubles are dissolved in the watery parts of fruits, vegetables, and grains, meaning The water-solubles's passage through the body is relatively straightforward.\",\n",
              " \" Examples of longitudinal waves include sound waves, and some types of shock waves, like seismic p-waves. Longitudinal waves on the other hand have oscillations that are parallel to the direction of energy transfer. Most waves we can think of are transverse, including all electromagnetic waves like light and radio waves, ripples and waves in water, and the waves of strings like on a guitar. So when light waves pass from a phone screen to your eye, or sound waves pass from the speakers to your ear, only energy is being transferred. The first thing to understand about waves is that waves transfer energy from one place to another, but waves don't transfer any matter. When transverse waves, the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer, or the direction in which the wave is moving, which is why on our drawing, the vibrations are going up and down, whilst the overall wave is travelling from left to right.\",\n",
              " \" Lastly, the nervous system is a communication network of nerve cells that The human body uses to transmit information and coordinate bodily functions. over 200 bones hold The human body together, give The human body shape, and protect The human body's organs and tissues. Humans are complicated organisms, but when Humans's 10 major organ systems are healthy, our 10 major organ systems ensure Humans's well-being. The respiratory system is a group of passageways and organs that extracts life-giving oxygen from the air we breathe. The adult skeletal system is a framework of over 200 bones. Ten major systems are responsible for The human body's functions, skeletal, the muscular system, which includes three types of muscles, skeletal, smooth, and cardiac, cardiovascular, nervous, endocrine, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive. the lungs extract oxygen for The human body to use and then expel a carbon dioxide by product when we exhale. Another key regulatory system is the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra maintains The human body's electrolyte levels and filters waste from the blood. This infrastructure created by neurons, blood, muscles, and bones allows three other systems to regulate The human body's environment, three other systems. The human body is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that together make life possible. hormones and other chemicals they need to produce are then distributed throughout The human body by way of the cardiovascular system, a pipeline that includes the heart, blood vessels, and the blood itself. The primary organs involved differ between the sexes with ovaries, fallopian tubes, the uterus, and vagina found in women and testes and a sperm channel found in men. the muscular system, which includes three types of muscles, skeletal, smooth, and cardiac are found throughout The human body and facilitate movement. The adult skeletal system also provides anchor points for the muscular system, which includes three types of muscles, skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. The digestive system is an approximately 30-foot series of organs that convert food into fuel. Also called the immune system, the lymphatic system, a collection of lymph nodes and vessels that help regulate the body's defenses uses neural pathways to transmit information about affected areas of The human body and then sends out healing agents like white blood cells via the bloodstream. The endocrine system is a series of glands that use information carried by the nervous system to help regulate The human body's processes. Nutrients are absorbed into the body while solid waste is expelled through the anal canal, the end of The digestive system. Nestled within the muscular system, which includes three types of muscles, skeletal, smooth, and cardiac is the cardiovascular system, a pipeline that includes the heart, blood vessels, and the blood the blood itself.\"]"
